"""Block-placement GDS skeleton for the PLL floorplan (issue #17).

WHAT IT IS
----------
A single top cell, ``pll_floorplan_skeleton``, containing one boundary
rectangle per block plus the two sub-block geometries this floorplan record
can state exactly (the loop-filter cap array and the VCO's committed on-chip
decap) -- see ``PLL-FLOORPLAN.md`` for the placement rationale and the area
budget every rectangle below is sized from.

WHY GDS LAYER (0, 0)
---------------------
Every rectangle is drawn on GDS layer 0, datatype 0 -- the ``DIEAREA``
layer in this PDK's KLayout layer map
(``$PDK_ROOT/libs.tech/klayout/tech/gf180mcu.map``). Confirmed by grepping
every rule file under ``$PDK_ROOT/libs.tech/klayout/drc/rule_decks/*.drc``:
no rule in this deck references layer (0, 0) at all. That makes it a
boundary/reference marker, never a device or routing layer -- exactly what a
block-placement *skeleton* should be drawn on, since none of these blocks
have real transistor-level layout yet (see the scope note at the top of
``PLL-FLOORPLAN.md``). Running this skeleton through the DRC deck is
therefore trivially clean by construction; the value is exercising #16's
multi-shape/multi-cell flow, not a claim about device-level correctness of
geometry that does not exist yet.

Positions and sizes below are float micron coordinates from
``PLL-FLOORPLAN.md`` sections 1-5; only the loop-filter C1 array (4x
87x87 um, DR-006) and the VCO decap (2x 50x50 um, ``vco.sch``) are real,
as-drawn device footprints. Everything else is the ROM block-footprint
estimate from that record's area-budget table, midpoint of the stated range.
